Ring Topology – Cisco Packet Tracer
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a Ring Topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, enabling efficient data transmission in a closed-loop path where each switch is connected to exactly two others.

📘 Project Overview
A Ring Topology forms a continuous pathway for signals through each switch in the network. Data travels in one direction (or both, in a dual-ring setup) until it reaches its destination.

Key Advantages:

Equal access for all devices

Predictable data transfer sequence

Can handle moderate network loads efficiently

🖥️ Network Topology
Components Used:

Switches: 4 × Cisco 2960-24TT

PCs: 4 × End devices with static IP addresses

Cables: Copper straight-through for PC-Switch connections, Copper cross-over for Switch-to-Switch connections

IP Address Plan:

Device	IP Address	Connected To
PC1	192.168.10.1	Switch1
PC2	192.168.10.2	Switch2
PC3	192.168.10.3	Switch3
PC0	192.168.10.4	Switch0

⚙️ Configuration Steps
1️⃣ Connect Devices

Connect each PC to its respective switch.

Interconnect all switches in a closed-loop (ring) configuration.

2️⃣ Assign IP Addresses

Configure each PC with its respective IP address and subnet mask (255.255.255.0).

3️⃣ Test Connectivity

Use the ping command between all PCs to verify complete connectivity.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand the concept of Ring Topology.

Learn to connect switches in a closed-loop configuration.

Assign and manage IP addresses for end devices.

Test data transmission across the ring.

🧠 Key Notes
If one link fails in a single ring, the network may go down unless it’s a dual-ring setup.

Easier to troubleshoot compared to full mesh, but less redundant.

Suitable for small-to-medium closed-loop networks.
